-- Part 2: Inferences and Analysis

-- Picking one city and category and grouping the businesses in that city or category by their overall star rating. Comparing the businesses with 2-3 stars to the businesses with 4-5 stars.
	
-- City: Las Vegas
-- Category: Restaurants



-- i. Do the two groups have a different distribution of hours?
	
	-- Yes, businesses in Las Vegas in the Restaurant category with an overall rating with 2-3 stars tend to have longer hours (13 hours of operation)
	-- than businesses in Las Vegas with an overall rating with 4-5 stars (9-13 hours of operation on weekdays, 6-13 hours of operation on weekends) 


-- ii. Do the two groups have a different number of reviews?
       
	-- Yes, businesses in Las Vegas in the Restaurant category with an overall rating of 2-3 stars have 123 reviews
	-- while businesses in Las Vegas in the Restaurant category with an overall rating of 4-5 stars have 168 and 768 reviews 
	-- (as there is only 1 restaurant in the 2-3 star category and only 2 restaurants in the 4-5 category)
	
	   
         
-- iii. Can we infer anything from the location data provided between these two groups?


-- As there is insufficient amount of sample data, I am unable to make any inferences based on location data. As there is only one restaurant in the 2-3 star category, the neighborhood field is empty.

-- i. Predicting the overall star rating for a business.

/*        
ii. 	The type of data I chose for the analysis I believe are factors that will be determinants of predicting the overall star rating for businesses. Knowing this, I decided to pull information of businesses 
		in Nevada and Arizona that label their basic location (city and state), as well as the number of reviews each business has received since opening, as I feel this will affect its overall star rating.
		I also decided to include its category as a possible factor, as well as the business hours, and perks that the business includes to see if it plays a factor in star rating.
